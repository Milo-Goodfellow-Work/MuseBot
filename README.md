# MuseBot

"Muse" is a discord bot designed to make practicing channels much simpler. The bot, when joining channels, begins by muting every user present. It then creates a queue of people wishing to perform and posting said queue, along with related commands, to the specified channel. The bot goes through the queue top to bottom, giving three minutes to each performer and a thirty-second break in-between.
